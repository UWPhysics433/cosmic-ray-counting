    "1. The differential unit of solid angle subtended by a small patch of surface $dA$ located a distance $r$ from an origin is given by the relationship $$d\\Omega = \\frac{\\hat{n}\\cdot d\\vec{A}}{r^2}$$ where $\\hat{n}$ is the unit radial vector from the origin and $d\\vec{A}$ is the differential area whose direction is perpendicular to the patch.\n",

For a patch lying parallel to the $x,y$ plane (i.e., $d\\vec{A}$ points along the $z$ axis) in rectagular coordinates, $\\hat{n}\\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\cos\\theta\\,dx\\,dy$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between the $z$ axis and $r$, the magnitude of $d\\vec{A}$ equals $dx\\,dy$, and $$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{z}{r} = \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$$.\n",
